    How old are you in a number of days? It's easy to calculate - just subtract your birthday from today. We could make
    this a real challenge though and count the difference between any dates.
</p>

<p>
    You are given two dates as an {% if is_js %}array{% else %}tuple{% endif %} with three numbers - a year, month and day. For example: 19 April 1982 will be
    (1982, 4, 19). You should find the difference in days between the given dates. For example between today and
    tomorrow = 1 day. The difference will always be either a positive number or zero, so don't forget about the absolute
    value.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input:</strong> Two dates as {% if is_js %}arrays of numbers{% else %}tuples of integers{% endif %}.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output:</strong> The difference between the dates in days as an {% if is_js %}number{% else %}integer{% endif %}.

    <strong>How it is used:</strong>
    Python has batteries included, so in this mission youâ€™ll need to learn how to use completed modules so that you
    don't have to invent the bicycle all over again.
